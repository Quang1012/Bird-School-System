            <h1>BIRD SCHOOL SYSTEM</h1>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> 
            <br>
            <p>Typically, some birders will want to train their birds so that they can recognize and do some of the owner requests. But they don't have much time, knowledge and experience when it comes to coaching it. As a result, they will lose time without getting any results. So we developed a bird training model system to help bird owners take less time and get better quality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This app is for bird lovers who wish their bird could do some of their requests. They don't have enough time or knowledge to train their birds. With our ornamental school system, they can now easily schedule ornamental bird training and follow the training. It is also possible to update your knowledge about ornamental birds through blog posts about ornamental birds. </p>
